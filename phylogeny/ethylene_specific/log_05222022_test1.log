Collapse 0 (over 30) internal branches having branch length <= 0.00142
 (settable via option -l)
Parameter to adjust variances was set to 0.0358 (settable via option -b)
Minimum branch length of time scaled tree (settable via option -u and -U): 0

*WARNINGS:
- There's not enough input date information to have a unique solution. 
The reported results show the lower solution: lower_rate and lower_dates.
For any coefficient k>=1, there's a corresponding solution where the rate is lower_rate*k,
and the date of any node i is lower_dates[i]/k

*RESULTS:
- Dating results:

The reported results show the lower solution: lower_rate and lower_dates.
For any coefficient k>=1, there's a corresponding solution where the rate is lower_rate*k,
and the date of any node i is lower_dates[i]/k
