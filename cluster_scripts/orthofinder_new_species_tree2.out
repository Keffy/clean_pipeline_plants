Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 1445285 genes (98.1% of total) to 49622 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 83 or more genes (G50 was 83) and were contained in the largest 5064 orthogroups (O50 was 5064). There were 8352 orthogroups with all species present and 0 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
